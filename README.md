# Introduction

I'm a former linguist with analytical experience, who works in a an operational data mining role, which involves the creation of custom analytics and the automation of technical analytic tradecraft. My personal projects are often geared towards professional development, but also frontend development and embedded projects with Raspberry Pi.

## My Dev Environment

I am currently experimenting with a custom installation of an Alpine Linux minimal root filesystem on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

I have a detailed setup guide [here](https://github.com/AndyRids/Alpine-WSL-Dev).

I am currently migrating my WSL2 dev environment to Void Linux. I had issues installing some python packages for use with MicroPython projects. These packages cannot easily include an sdist, meaning they cannot be installed on Alpine, which uses `musl` and not `glibc`. A custom rootfs Void Linux
installation was much easier to setup on WSL2 than Alpine.
